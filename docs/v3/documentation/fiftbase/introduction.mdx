# Introduction

This document provides a brief description of Fift, a stack-based general‑purpose programming language optimized for creating, debugging, and managing TON Blockchain smart contracts.

Fift is designed to work closely with the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) and the TON Blockchain. In particular, it offers:
- Native support for 257‑bit integer arithmetic
- Shared TVM primitives for manipulating cells, slices, and builders
- An interface to Ed25519 cryptography used by TON
- A macro‑assembler for writing TVM code

While Fift is conceptually similar to Forth, there are important differences: Fift enforces runtime type checking and keeps values of different types on its stack, not only integers.

:::note
The original “Fift: A Brief Introduction” describes an early version of the language; some minor details may have evolved since then.

## Interactive parsing model (high level)

Fift reads input line by line, splits it into words, and executes them as they are recognized:
- If a word is found in the dictionary, it is executed immediately.
- If no word matches, the next token is interpreted as an Integer literal and pushed on the stack.
- Some words require a trailing blank (space or end-of-line); prefix words do not.

For example, entering the following in interactive mode:

```fift
2 3 + .
```

pushes `2`, then `3`, computes the sum with `+`, and prints it with `.`. You will see output similar to:

```text
5 ok
```
