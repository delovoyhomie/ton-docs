# Fift Base Manual

This section presents an MDX-formatted version of “Fift: A Brief Introduction” by Nikolai Durov (Feb 6, 2020), adapted to the docs.ton.org structure for easier navigation and cross-linking with TVM and smart-contract documentation.

## What is Fift

Fift is a stack-based general-purpose language optimized for creating, debugging, and managing TON smart contracts. It is designed to interact with the TON Virtual Machine (TVM) and the TON Blockchain, providing:
- Native 257-bit integer arithmetic
- Shared TVM cell/slice/builder primitives
- Ed25519 cryptographic primitives
- A macro-assembler for TVM code

If you are familiar with Forth, Fift will feel conceptually similar while adding runtime type checking and first-class non-integer stack values.
